# ml-test

Hello Daniel. Thank you for such a great test, i had a lot of fun doing it. Although this in an incomplete version and i know there are some missing features i just want it to give it a try anyway. Currently i have a job so it is a little bit difficult for me to find some more time to finish it. I would like to have some feedback if you have some time. Im not sure how to train using fp16 using mixed precision with fsdp v2 for instance.
